# Arcade Snake
## What is it?
This is a classic minimalist version of arcade snake videogame. I make it in HTML5 using CreateJS library (and without sound).

## Controls
You can control the snake pushing keyboard arrows up, down, left and right. You objetive is the red rectangle, if you got it, you'll gain points.
